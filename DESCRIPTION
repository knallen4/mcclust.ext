Description: This is an extension of the mcclust package. It provides 
	post-processing tools for MCMC samples of partitions to summarize 
	the posterior in Bayesian clustering models. Functions for point 
	estimation are provided, giving a single representative clustering 
	of the posterior. And, to characterize uncertainty in the point 
	estimate, credible balls can be computed.
